# My Data structures and Algorithms Playground
This repository serves as a practical resource to aid my personal study and understanding of the fundamental concepts in ```"Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (2001)``` with the goal is to implementing various algorithms from the book.

### Array Indexing
From Wikipedia
> Martin Richards, creator of the BCPL language (a precursor of C), designed arrays initiating at 0 as the natural position to start accessing the array contents in the language, since the value of a pointer p used as an address accesses the position p + 0 in memory.

The memory address of the first element in an array is the starting point, and indexing an array element corresponds directly to offsetting from that memory address sounds natural and efficient. That's why in this playground I will use zero-based indexing.
