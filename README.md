# My Data structures and Algorithms Playground
This repository serves as a practical resource to aid my personal study and understanding of the fundamental concepts in ```"Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (2001)``` with the goal is to implementing various algorithms from the book.

### Array Indexing
From Wikipedia
> Martin Richards, creator of the BCPL language (a precursor of C), designed arrays initiating at 0 as the natural position to start accessing the array contents in the language, since the value of a pointer p used as an address accesses the position p + 0 in memory.

The notation "array $A[1:n]$" is used to describe an array named $A$ that contains $n$ items. But notice that in the implementation, the array $A$ will use zero-based indexing: $A[0], A[1], ... A[n-1]$
